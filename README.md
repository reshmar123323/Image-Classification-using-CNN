# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Using a CNN, we'll classify the CIFAR-10 dataset with 60,000 32x32 color images grouped into 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). The dataset comprises 50,000 training images, 10,000 testing images, and five uneven training batches, along with a test batch of 1,000 images per class.
